# Snake-Example
A simple Snake game made in Java using Swing.
This example is complete and fully functioning. Most of it has been commented and is easily readable. However I have not had time to fully optimize and refactor it.

Only contains java source files. You will have to open on your own editor and build it yourself to run it.

Controls:

Left Arrow - Move Left

Right Arrow - Move Right

Up Arrow - Move Up

Down Arrow - Move Down

Enter - Cheat Mode

The max snake size is 1000 so If you get that high you completed the game! Theres no pause button but you can just enter cheat mode then switch it off.
